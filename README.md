The rules of Ayo may vary slightly depending on the region, but the general rules are as follows:

Players take turns to sow seeds (stones) from one of their pits.
If the last seed is dropped into an empty pit on the player's side and the opposite pit has seeds, the player captures those seeds.
The game ends when one player has no seeds left in their pits.
The player with the most captured seeds wins.
